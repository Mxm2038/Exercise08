## Site Architecture & Relative Paths

The objective of this task is to understand how to properly organize the files of a web site and use relative paths to link all documents and images together within that structure.

You are not expected to complete this in one session. What you do not finish in class, spend time practicing at home. Always start from the beginning. **Do not copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**

## Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Included in the directory on your computer are the following files and directory:

- cat-bg.png
- charlie.html
- charlie.jpg
- coby.html
- coby.jpg
- flynn.html
- flynn.jpg
- index.html
- piper.html
- piper.jpg
- quorra.html
- quorra.jpg
- style.css
- README.md (this file)
- zedo.html
- zedo.jpg

### Here is what you need to do

**All work needs to be done in the `exercise-08` folder.** (It may be named `exercise-08-master`.)

**You may not re-name files or move them into a different directory structure other than what is displayed below.**

Organize the files as follows. You may choose to organize the files using the 'Tree View' (left column) in Atom, or in the macOS finder.

- black-n-white/
  - charlie.html
- css/
  - style.css  
- img/
  - cat-bg.png
  - charlie.jpg
  - coby.jpg
  - flynn.jpg
  - piper.jpg
  - quorra.jpg
  - zedo.jpg
- index.html
- snowshoe/
  - coby.html
- tabby/
  - flynn.html
  - piper.html
  - quorra.html
- tux/
  - zedo.html


1. Make sure the step above is complete. If it is not, you cannot complete this exercise accordingly.

   Open each HTML file. Find the tags which have properties such as `href` (for links and the css file) or `src` (for images) and link them using **relative paths**.

2. Look at documentation (or a previous example?) for how to add a stylesheet with a `link` tag. Make the styles contained in `style.css` appear on the web page. What properties are necessary to make the stylesheet work?

3. Fix `style.css` so it includes `cat-bg.png` as a background. In `style.css`, look on line 2 for: `background: url("");` What is the path to `cat-bg.png`?

The exercise is complete when all links are working and images appear.

### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Organize your files. If you do not organize the files, you can not move on to Step 2. Work with each file one-by-one. Do not assume all files will have the same paths. Yes, patterns may develop, but make sure you are linking to the right images, files.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class.  If you finish, have your professor give it a look.  If you *are* finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

Things to ask yourself if you run into problems:

  - Are your file names correct?
  - Are you trying to 'go forward' into a path which does not exist?
  - Are you remembering to go back a directory?
  - Are there typos?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
